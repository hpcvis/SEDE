	<h2> Challenges and Opportunities in Remote and In-situ</h2>
	<h2> Sensing: A Data and Software Perspective</h2>

        <p id="description">          
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
		Data generated by remote and in-situ sensing has entered
		the big data realm and is an opportunity to unravel
		complex processes of earth and human systems.  This talk
		provides the emerging challenges and opportunities in
		remote and in-situ sensing with a specific attention to
		overlaps with data engineering and software engineering.
		The whole life cycle of sensing from sensor design,
		deployment, and management to data harvesting, processing,
		and analysis is supported by science and technology
		rendered by data engineering and software engineering
		disciplines.  Data engineering provides the practical
		infrastructure of data generation and collection and
		software engineering provides architecture of data
		processing and analysis.  The talk will focus on recent
		trends in remote and in-situ sensing disciplines and their
		emerging challenges that would benefit from advances in
		data engineering and software engineering.

          <strong>Bio:</strong>

		Dr. Haroon Stephen is Associate Professor in the
		Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at
		the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Dr. Haroon Stephen
		is involved in interdisciplinary research of climate
		change impact and hydrology with specific emphasis on
		applications of remote sensing and geographic information
		systems (GIS) and specific focus on safeguarding and
		improving urban quality of life. He has substantial
		experience in acquisition, processing, visualization,
		archiving, and utilization of geospatial data. He has
		been involved in several Federal and State sponsored
		research projects involving research and applications of
		geospatial data. In these projects, he has worked with
		the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation,
		US Forest Service, City of Las Vegas, Nevada Division of
		Forestry, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection,
		and Nevada Department of Transportation. He has
		developed the Visualization Facility at UNLV that
		provides state-of-the-art visualization of complex
		datasets and processes for research and educational
		needs of UNLV and the region. He also provides GIS and
		Remote Sensing research and training support to UNLV
		campus. He has participated in various competitive
		research grants, including National Science Foundation
		grants titled "The Solar Energy-Water-Environment
		Nexus in Nevada", and "Collaborative Research: The
		Western Consortium for Watershed Analysis, Visualization,
		and Exploration." Currently, he is lead PI of a $2.5M
		National Science Foundation project titled "Enhancing
		Critical Transitions in Civil Engineering Degree". His
		ongoing research interests include applications of remote
		sensing and GIS technologies to water resource mapping;
		transportation; and natural and urban climate study. Some
		active projects include urban heat island mapping; urban
		flood modeling; regional emission inventory development;
		and environmental impacts of solar energy farms.
