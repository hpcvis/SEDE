	<h2>Software Development:</h2>
	<h2> the Past, Present, and Future </h2>

        <p id="description">          
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
		
	In the field of software development, the processes, technologies, and 
	practices have been matured over the time to achieve a higher level of 
	delivery and quality. However, the development phase, which is an essential 
	part of the software development life cycle (SDLC), is still consuming a 
	significant cost (time and resources) in both approaches, waterfall and agile.

	The reason behind that, current technologies and approaches of software 
	development are somehow following the same rules and practices since decades, 
	and didn’t evolve in the proper velocity over the time.

	In this talk, and based on real-life case studies, we will discuss how the 
	utilization of components reusability (API’s and frameworks), Metadata-driven 
	development, Code Generation, and Artificial Intelligence can make the software 
	development more efficient by creating a holistic approach to creating software systems. 
          <br><br>
