	<h2> Data science to mitigate global warming effects </h2>

        <p id="description">          
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
		For most data analysis, roughly 80% of the effort is spent on data collection, formatting, and pre-processing, and 20% on analysis. 
		But what happens when all these steps stand in the way of focusing on the actual science? Such is the case with finding associations 
		between regions of DNA, different traits, and environmental factors. The genomic data (DNA) is large and either stored in specialized 
		databases along with the traits, or in various file formats. The environmental data is made publicly available by various websites 
		as large files, each containing a few variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) for a specific region or for the whole world, with 
		the data using one of the hundreds of standard GIS projections. From each file though, a user needs to extract the values only for a 
		few geographic locations, using either proprietary software, R or Python scripts, or command line tools. And the analysis is too 
		complex for a laptop, or even a server, and needs to run on high performance compute cluster (HPC). The existing software makes it 
		virtually impossible for a biologist or ecologist to perform such an analysis. To address this, we are proposing a web application 
		that allows a user to select the data through an intuitive graphical user interface, to pre-process it using interactive charts, to 
		send it for analysis on an HPC, and to display the results back on a map.
